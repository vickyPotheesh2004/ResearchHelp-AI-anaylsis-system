- **🎓 IEEE Official Paper Generator**: Synthesize academic manuscripts complete with Abstracts, Literature Reviews, and Methodologies, auto-formatted into professional Times New Roman, two-column style `.docx` files.
- **🧪 Simple English Deep Analysis**: Specialized research mode that breaks down complex domains into simple, jargon-free English using real-world analogies.
- **⚡ Token-by-Token Streaming**: Answers stream in real-time. No more waiting for a full response.
- **🔊 Voice Narration (Web Speech API)**: Listen to document overviews, AI suggestions, and chat responses via embedded TTS buttons.
- **🖼️ AI Image Generation**: Ask for a "visual understanding" and the system will dynamically paint an AI-generated image (via Pollinations.ai) to explain the concept.
- **📊 Interactive Flowcharts**: Diagrams are rendered live as colored, interactive Mermaid flowcharts matching the app's theme.
- **📄 Comprehensive Export**: Download your entire session in **Markdown**, **HTML**, or fully-styled **Word (.docx)**.

## 🚀 Core Features & Capabilities

### 1. Multi-Format Document Ingestion
- Supports **PDF**, **DOCX**, **TXT**, **CSV**, **XLSX**, **PNG**, **JPG** formats.
- **OCR-Powered Extraction**: Uses Tesseract OCR to extract text from scanned documents and images.
- **Structured Data Parsing**: Reads tabular data from CSV/Excel via Pandas.
- Intelligent chunking mechanism to handle massive documents seamlessly.

### 2. Advanced Intent Classification System
At the heart of ResearchHelp-AI-anaylsis-system is a 6-category smart routing engine that categorizes every query before processing. This ensures the correct prompt template and analysis logic is applied.

| Intent Category | Trigger Example | Functionality |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 📄 `document_qa` | "What hardware is used?" | Direct factual Q&A from the document context. |
| 💡 `suggestion_request` | "How can we improve this?" | Gap analysis and actionable improvement suggestions. |
| 🔬 `research_addon` | "Can we add solar power?" | Technical feasibility assessment and risk analysis. |
| 🧪 `research_analysis` | "Explain Quantum Computing" | Deep analysis in **VERY SIMPLE English** with analogies. |
| 🎓 `ieee_paper_gen` | "Generate an IEEE paper" | Synthesizes a formal research manuscript in DOCX format. |
| 🚫 `off_topic` | "What is the weather?" | Polite redirection to keep the session focused. |

### 3. Dynamic Domain-Specific Expert Routing
ResearchHelp-AI-anaylsis-system doesn't just categorize the *intent* of your question; it identifies the *domain* you are researching. 
By scanning both your prompt and the retrieved context, the system detects keywords associated with 44 specific disciplines (e.g., `Cybersecurity`, `Maths`, `Deep Learning`, `Computer Networks`, `Biomedical Engineering`). 
When a domain is detected, ResearchHelp-AI-anaylsis-system dynamically injects an overarching, expert-crafted directive for that specific field into the LLM prompt. This forces the model to:
- **Adopt a Domain-Specific Analytical Lens** (e.g., evaluating threat limits for Cybersecurity, analyzing packet limits and latency logic for Networks).
- **Enforce Output Constraints** (e.g., outputting pure LaTeX symbols for Maths, formatting outputs around the SDLC for Software Engineering).

### 4. The IEEE Official Paper Generator
ResearchHelp-AI-anaylsis-system acts as an automated collaborative researcher:
1. **Metadata Collection**: Enter your team names, official emails, college affiliations, and paper title in the **📝 IEEE Metadata** tab.
2. **Context Synthesis**: The AI reviews your uploaded documents and your entire chat history.
3. **Scholarly Prompting**: The `IEEE_PAPER_PROMPT` enforces a strict academic structure (Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, Results, Conclusion, References).
4. **Professional Output**: Generates an instantly downloadable `IEEE_Paper.docx` formatted to simulate professional publication standards.

### 4. Hybrid Retrieval Engine (Semantic + BM25)
ResearchHelp-AI-anaylsis-system ensures no piece of context is missed by running a dual-channel retrieval system:
- **70% Semantic Search (ChromaDB)**: Finds conceptually relevant passages using `all-mpnet-base-v2` dense embeddings, even if different terminology is used.
- **30% Keyword Search (BM25 Okapi)**: Catches precise, exact-match technical terms that dense embeddings might underrate.
- **Re-Ranking Pipeline**: Merges, deduplicates, and ranks the top 12 chunks for maximum context injection into the LLM.

### 5. Intelligent Topic Segmentation
Documents aren't just split randomly; they are segmented semantically:
- **Cosine Similarity Drops**: Detects topic shifts dynamically when consecutive sentence embeddings drop below a 0.78 similarity threshold.
- **LLM Context Titling**: Automatically generates concise 2-word titles for every semantic segment.
- **Abbreviation-Aware Splitting**: Prevents accidental splits on "Dr.", "e.g.", ensuring complete sentences.

### 6. Auto-Generated Document Insights
The moment your documents are ingested, ResearchHelp-AI-anaylsis-system provides:
- **Document Overview**: A structured, high-level summary of the entire corpus.
- **AI Suggestions**: 5 categorized, actionable research suggestions (Improvement, Innovation, Gap Analysis, Optimization).

### 7. Session Analytics & Complete Transparency
- **Real-Time Dashboards**: Track source usage, topics explored, and queries asked in the sidebar.
- **Expandable Source Cards**: Every AI response includes clickable citations showing exactly which document chunk was used, its relevance score, and the original text.
- **Logic Traces**: View the underlying LLM "chain of thought" to understand *how* it arrived at its conclusions.
